 * Set this to the number of recyclable tasks for the task pool to cache.
 *
 * Caching dynamically allocated tasks (recyclable tasks) helps the application
 * to limit the number of allocations at runtime. Caching recyclable tasks may
 * help making the application more responsive and predictable, by removing a
 * potential for memory allocation failures, but it may also have negative
 * repercussions on the amount of memory available at any given time. It is up
 * to the application developer to strike the correct balance these competing
 * needs. The task pool will cache when the application calling
 * IotTaskPool_RecycleJob. Any recycled tasks in excess of
 * IOT_TASKPOOL_JOBS_RECYCLE_LIMIT will be destroyed and its memory will be
 * release.
